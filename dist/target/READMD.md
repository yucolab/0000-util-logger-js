as of 2022-09-20, only 3 are included :

other possible targets can be : 

- https ( local centralized server, but without internet access ) ; 
- syslog ; 
- database ( mysql or mongodb );
- treasure data server side agent ; 
- logstash ; 

none of these are planned though, just make a note here for reference only ~
